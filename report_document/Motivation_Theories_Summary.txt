Lecture Notes: Summary of Motivation Theories

1. Content Theories (What motivates us?)
-------------------------------------------------
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: Human needs arranged from basic (physiological) to self-actualization.
- ERG Theory (Alderfer): Condenses Maslow's five needs into three categories: Existence, Relatedness, Growth.
- Two-Factor Theory (Herzberg): Motivation comes from 'motivators' (growth, recognition) and 'hygiene factors' (salary, conditions).
- McGuire's Motivations: Categorizes psychological motives into cognitive and affective domains.
- Murray's System of Needs: Includes needs for achievement, affiliation, and power.
- Need Theory: Motivation driven by individual needs (achievement, affiliation, power).

2. Process Theories (How motivation occurs?)
-------------------------------------------------
- Expectancy Theory: Motivation is a product of expectancy (effort -> performance), instrumentality (performance -> reward), and valence (value of reward).
- Expectancy-Value Theory: Emphasizes beliefs about how effort affects outcomes and how much the outcome is valued.
- Equity Theory: Motivation is influenced by perceived fairness in social exchanges.
- Goal Theory & Goal Orientation: Setting specific, challenging goals enhances motivation and performance.
- Cognitive Dissonance: Discomfort from conflicting beliefs/actions motivates change to reduce inconsistency.
- Cognitive Evaluation Theory: External rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation.
- Self-Determination Theory (SDT): Focuses on autonomy, competence, and relatedness for sustaining intrinsic motivation.
- Temporal Motivation Theory: Incorporates time-sensitive value into motivation decisions (procrastination model).
- Self-Worth Theory of Motivation: Protecting self-worth becomes a primary motivator, influencing task choices.
- Theory X and Theory Y: Assumptions about human nature (X: people dislike work; Y: people seek responsibility) affect motivation strategies.
- Regulatory Focus Theory: Individuals are motivated by promotion (gains) or prevention (avoiding losses) focus.
- Regulatory Mode Theory: Describes how people regulate their goal pursuit (locomotion vs. assessment modes).

3. Incentive & Social Influence Theories
-------------------------------------------------
- Incentive Theory (Implied): Motivation driven by external rewards.
- Achievement Ideology: Belief that success is the result of hard work motivates behavior.
- Ben Franklin Effect: Doing favors for someone increases liking for them (self-justification mechanism).
- Community Recognition: Motivation through gaining acknowledgment from one's community.
- Motivation Crowding Theory: Extrinsic incentives can displace intrinsic motivation.
- Knowledge Falsification & Preference Falsification: Concealing true beliefs/preferences due to social pressure.
- Risk Aversion (Psychology): Tendency to avoid losses over acquiring equivalent gains influences decisions.
- Yale Attitude Change Approach: Focus on persuasive communication affecting attitudes and motivation.

4. Other Theories & Concepts
-------------------------------------------------
- Drive Theory: Behavior driven by biological drives to maintain homeostasis.
- Drive-Reduction Theory: Behavior motivated to reduce internal tensions caused by unmet needs.
- Arousal Theory: Seeking optimal arousal levels for best performance.
- Disconfirmed Expectancy: Motivation arises when expectations are unmet, leading to increased effort or reassessment.
- Expected Utility Hypothesis: Decision-making based on maximizing expected utility (value) of outcomes.
- Hedonism: Pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as primary motivators.
- Holland Codes: Career motivation linked to personality-job environment fit.
- Job Characteristic Theory: Job design (variety, autonomy, feedback) influences motivation.
- Learned Industriousness: Reinforcement of high effort leads to sustained industriousness.
- Life-Span Model of Motivation: Motivation changes across different life stages.
- Mortality Salience: Awareness of mortality influences motivation and behaviors.
- Optimal Stimulation Level: Individuals seek levels of stimulation optimal to their personality.
- Psychological Determinism: Behavior is determined by prior causes and unconscious motives.
- Action Regulation Theory: Emphasizes regulation of goal-directed actions through planning and feedback.
- C. Bertrand Thompson: Early work on motivation in management and labor productivity.
